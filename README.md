Hide Pull Requests
==================

This repository contains an old-style Google Chrome Extension to hide pull requests from the issue view of a GitHub repository.
GitHub's web interface now does this automatically, so this extension is rendered obsolete.
Still, this repository is left up on GitHub for legacy purposes.
